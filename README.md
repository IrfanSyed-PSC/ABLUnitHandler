# ABLUnitHandler
Currently ABLUnit tests procedures/classes can be executed either from command line,ANT build or _progres/prowin clients. To run the the same tests over HTTP and invoke them as RESTful services, we have taken advantage of PASOE as a platform to develop testing services as we have written a WebHandler to invoke ABLUnit tests and REST API's to manage them.
